A Telegram bot that can assist users/groups on geocaching

Features:
--------
- watch for GCxxxxx mentions and turn them into something nice


Dependencies:
 - pycaching : https://github.com/tomasbedrich/pycaching
   Framework to get info from geocaching.com
 - python-telegram-bot: https://github.com/leandrotoledo/python-telegram-bot
   Framework to talk to the Telegram bot API

Installation / Configuration:
----------------------------
Copy the geocachebot.cfg.sample to geocachebot.cfg and fill in the
appropriate details. Most notabley your Telegram TOKEN needs to be
filled in.

The defaults for the templates should give you a working bot withouth
having to change them.

If you want to run the bot authenticated, which may or may not be
against the geocaching.com terms of service, a user and password can
be specified in the [geocaching] section.

In the 'config' folder there is a systemd unit file for running the
bot under systemd regime. If you use systemd's feature for running
user services, do not forget to enable 'lingering' for your user,
otherwise the process will be stopped after your user session ends.

Ideas for improvement:
---------------------
- /wtf TLA -> describes what TLA means (bonus points for editting possibilities)
  Basically this page: https://www.geocaching.com/about/glossary.aspx but dynamic.
- activate travel bugs should be possible (low usage case though)
- describe scope (commands, detectors etc.)
