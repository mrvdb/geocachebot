A Telegram bot that can assist users/groups on geocaching

Features:
- watch for GCxxxxx mentions and turn them into something nice


Dependencies:
 - pycaching : https://github.com/tomasbedrich/pycaching
   Framework to get info from geocaching.com
 - python-telegram-bot: https://github.com/leandrotoledo/python-telegram-bot
   Framework to talk to the Telegram bot API


Ideas for improvement:
- /wtf TLA -> describes what TLA means (bonus points for editting possibilities)
  Basically this page: https://www.geocaching.com/about/glossary.aspx but dynamic.
- activating travel bugs
- describe scope (commands, detectors etc.)
- use webhooks for communication instead of getupdates
