@geocachebot aims to assist with geocaching

Features:
  - scans for GC-codes and TB-code  in messages and displays info on the cache or trackable when it is valid; This works automatically, you do not need to issue a command for this. Having something like 'GC1234' in your message is enough. 
  

Commands:
  /help : displays this text


Notes:
  - As the bot scans for GC codes it needs access to all messages (privacy-mode is off)
  - Trackable information (on TB codes) can only be shown when the both is logged in to geocaching.com.
