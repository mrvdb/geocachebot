@geocachebot aims to assist with geocaching

Features:
  - scans for GC-codes in messages and displays info on the cache when it is a valid cache; This works automatically, you do not need to issue a command for this. Having something like 'GC1234' in your message is enough.

Commands:
  /help : displays this text


Notes:
  - As the bot scans for GC codes it nees access to all messages (privacymode is off)
